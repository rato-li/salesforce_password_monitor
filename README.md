Advanced Mechanism for Salesforce Password Expiry Detection
As a data engineer working with Salesforce DataLoader automation, here's a comprehensive solution to handle password expiration and security token invalidation:

1. Proactive Expiry Detection System
2. Complementary Solutions
A. Metadata API Approach
B. Scheduled Monitoring Job
C. Integration with Secret Management
3. Implementation Recommendations
Configuration Management:

Store credentials in a secure vault (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault)

Use environment-specific configuration files

Alerting Channels:

Email notifications

Slack/Teams webhook integration

PagerDuty for critical alerts

Monitoring Dashboard:

Track authentication success/failure rates

Visualize password expiry timeline

Maintain audit logs of credential rotations

Preventive Measures:

Implement credential rotation 1-2 weeks before expected expiry

Use OAuth refresh tokens where possible

Consider using Connected Apps with IP restrictions

Error Handling:

Graceful degradation of DataLoader jobs

Automatic retry with exponential backoff

Circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures

This solution provides proactive monitoring rather than reactive failure detection, helping maintain uninterrupted DataLoader operations.
